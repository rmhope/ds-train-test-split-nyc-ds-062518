    "Thus far we've simply been fitting models to data and calculating the error between various models and the actual data. This can lead to various problems such as overfitting where we overtune our models to these specific data points and fail to disern more generalizable patterns that will apply to future cases. \n",

    "Now that you've seen some basic linear regression models it's time to discuss further how to better tune these models. As you saw, we usually begin with an error or loss function for which we'll apply an optimization algorithm such as gradient descent. We then apply this optimization algorithm to the error function we're trying to minimize and voila, we have an optimized solution! Unfortunately, things aren't quite that simple. \n",

Generally, the more data that we have the better off we'll be as we can observe more patterns and relationships within that data. However, some of these patterns and relationships may not generalize well to other cases. "

By initially dividing our data into one set that we will optimize and train our models on, and a second hold out set that we later verify our models on but never tune them against, we can better judge how well our models will generalize to future cases outside of the scope of current observations."
